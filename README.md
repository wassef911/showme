# showme

This is a dummy project part of march side sprint.

## Development

To run the project locally use this set of commands:

```bash
python3 -v venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

## Project structure

```bash
$ tree "showme"
showme

├── db  # module contains db configurations
│   ├── dao  # Data Access Objects. Contains different classes to interact with database.
│   └── models  # Package contains different models for ORMs.

    │   └── router.py  # Main router.
    ├── application.py  # FastAPI application configuration.
    └── lifetime.py  # Contains actions to perform on startup and shutdown.
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here.

All environment variables should start with "SHOWME\_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "showme/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "SHOWME_RANDOM_PARAMETER"
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `showme.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:

```bash
SHOWME_RELOAD="True"
SHOWME_PORT="80"
SHOWME_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

## OpenTelemetry

If you want to start your project with OpenTelemetry collector
you can add `-f ./deploy/docker-compose.otlp.yml` to your docker command.

Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.otlp.yml --project-directory . up
```

This command will start OpenTelemetry collector and jaeger.
After sending a requests you can see traces in jaeger's UI
at http://localhost:16686/.

This docker configuration is not supposed to be used in production.
It's only for demo purpose.

You can read more about OpenTelemetry here: https://opentelemetry.io/

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

## Migrations

If you want to migrate your database, you should run following commands:

```bash
# To run all migrations until the migration with revision_id.
alembic upgrade "<revision_id>"

# To perform all pending migrations.
alembic upgrade "head"
```

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:

```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
 alembic downgrade base
```

### Migration generation

To generate migrations you should run:

```bash
# For automatic change detection.
alembic revision --autogenerate

# For empty file generation.
alembic revision
```

## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose run --build --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose down
```

For running tests on your local machine.

2. Run the pytest.
